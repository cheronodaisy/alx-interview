0. Minimum Operations
In a text file, there is a single character H. Your text editor can 
execute only two operations in this file: Copy All and Paste. Given a 
number n, write a method that calculates the fewest number of operations 
needed to result in exactly n H characters in the file.

Prototype: def minOperations(n)
Returns an integer
If n is impossible to achieve, return 0

This problem is akin to finding the prime factorization of the number 'n'. 
Essentially, the number of operations required is related to finding the 
minimum sequence of actions to reach 'n' H characters in the file.
